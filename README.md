# MENTORNEAR MVP CONCEPT

[Link to Live Demo App ](https://alexsjcho.github.io/mentor-near-api-capstone/)

This is an MVP of this start-up concept of Mentorship service similar to a dating app like Tinder, CoffeeMeetsBagel, and shared economy concepts like Lyft and Uber.

However, due to the scope of this project, I was limited to only using 3rd party APIs, so it's not fully what it could be, but it's sufficient to demonstrate the app concept.

## CHALLENGES

1. **Priority Management**: Figuring out which features are worth the time and core to product.
2. **Time Management**: Keeping app within 1 week scope
3. **Focus with Limited Tools**: The focus of this app was to ultilize 3rd party APIs in a meaningful way, however, we were limited to just using JavaScript and jQuery, therefore, it was hard to accomplish the neatness and organization that comes with React.

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

1. _Build A React App Version_: Using pure jQuery and JavaScript to accomplish this app was a nightmare, if I had attempted this project using React, the process would be neater, code more maintainable and readable for everyone.
2. _Use JavaScript Modules_: I was not experienced with JavaScript modules, therefore, all my JavaScript code lived in 1 file which made it really difficult to deal with
