###MentorNear MVP Concept

This is an MVP of this start-up concept of Mentorship service similar to a dating app like Tinder, CoffeeMeetsBagel, and shared economy concepts like Lyft and Uber.

However, due to the scope of this project, I was limited to only using 3rd party APIs, so it's not fully what it could be, but it's sufficient to demonstrate the app concept.

###Technologies Used

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap
4. Normalize.css
5. Javascript
6. jQuery
7. 3rd Party APIs: [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/), [Random Quotes Generator](https://theysaidso.com/api/#random)
8. [Dates.js Library](https://github.com/datejs/Datejs)
